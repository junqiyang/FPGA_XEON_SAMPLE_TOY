matrix 4x4: still under development, the output isn't correct. Should look into the multiplier.

IO-Test: simple one read and one write, all development can base on this

IO-Test-2: a read then write cycle, use to test IO format

IO-Test-3: two read then write cycle AFU connect to CPU by spl, use to determine IO speed.
